How long did you spend working on this project?
This project took a LONGGG TIME. I gave probably 5 hours a week for about 3-4 weeks.
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge I conquered was finally understanding the difference between class methods and instance methods
What two additional features did you build? Why?
1) Restocking toys
2) Created customer wishlist
Where do you still have room to grow?
I still have difficulty figuring out the relationship between classes and how to access methods that exist in other classes.
