How long did you spend working on this project?
This project took a LONGGG TIME. I gave probably 5 hours a week for about 3-4 weeks.
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge I conquered was finally understanding the difference between class methods and instance methods

1) Restocking toys
2) Created customer wishlist
